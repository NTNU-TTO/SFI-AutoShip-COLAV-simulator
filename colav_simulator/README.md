# colav-simulator
This repository implements a framework for simulating and evaluating autonomous ship collision avoidance (COLAV) control strategies. The initial framework prototype is described in the [CCTA2023 paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10252863). As of September 2023, the simulation framework has been wrapped to be compatible with [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) and [Stable Baselines](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3), such that you can now use it as a gym for training RL-agents (beta version). Please rely on the code itself for the main documentation. This readme serves as a brief walkthrough guide.

The main functionality is contained in the `Simulator` class of `simulator.py`, which runs through fully defined scenarios generated by the `ScenarioGenerator`, which takes in scenario configuration files in `.yaml` format (examples under `scenarios/`). One can visualize the results underway, save the results, and use the `colav_evaluation_tool` afterwards to evaluate the performance of the own-ship (potentially) running a COLAV algorithm. These three main modules have default configurations specified under `config/`, change according to your own needs. The `seacharts` package is used to provide usage of Electronic Navigational Charts for visualization and anti-grounding purposes. See the examples and tests for simple tutorials on how to use the repository. The `rrt-rs` package enables grounding-free trajectory planning and behavior generations for vessels involved in a simulation. Lastly, the `vimmjipda` package can be used for enabling Multi-Target Tracking in the simulation.

The framework uses the North-East coordinate system with values in meters, speed in meters per second, angles in radians, and angular velocities in radians per second.

The framework is mainly developed and tested under a Unix-based operating system (Linux, macOS).

## Dependencies
Are all outlined in setup.cfg. Non-pip packages to install are

- seacharts: https://github.com/trymte/seacharts for ENC support
- rrt-rs: https://github.com/NTNU-Autoship-Internal/rrt-rs optionally for ship behavior generation
- vimmjipda: <https://github.com/NTNU-Autoship-Internal/vimmjipda> for Multi-Target Tracking functionality.
- colav_evaluation_tool: https://github.com/trymte/colav_evaluation_tool (optional dependency only for the `test_simulation_and_evaluation.py` test file)

## Generic Install Instructions
`seacharts`, `vimmjipda` and the `colav_evaluation_tool` (optional) are non-pip package dependencies in the simulator. Install these as editable packages first using `pip install -e .` in their respective root folders. For `rrt-rs` (also optional), follow the install instructions at <https://github.com/NTNU-Autoship-Internal/rrt-rs>. Then, install this simulator package using the same `pip install -e .` command inside the `colav_simulator` root folder. All of these packages should be installed using the same Python environment (e.g. a virtual or Conda environment).

To use `seacharts` in the simulator, you should download `.gdb` files from <https://kartkatalog.geonorge.no> in UTM 32 or 33 (see <https://github.com/trymte/seacharts> for instructions), and put into the `data/external` folder in the seacharts package directory. Otherwise, the module will not find any ENC data to use.

If you get troubles installing `gdal`, this might be due to:
- The native `gdal`library not being installed, see e.g. <https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/issues/2166>
- It not being installed correctly. Try to install from source or fix the gdal-version (see e.g. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34408699/having-trouble-installing-gdal-for-python> or <https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/issues/2827>). An issue on the topic is found on <https://github.com/trymte/seacharts/issues/4>

If you get troubles with import errors caused by not finding dependencies such as fiona, try to reinstall the dependencies causing error.

Test the installation by running any of the files under `tests/`, e.g.
```
python3 tests/test_ship.py
```
use these and the examples to get familiar with the simulator.

## Git Workflow

All contributors are obligated to follow methods as outlined in <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow> for ensuring a pain-free workflow with the repository.

If you're unfamiliar with git, check out <https://try.github.io/> to get familiar, and use <https://learngitbranching.js.org/> for trying out topics on your own.

### Main branch

The `main` branch shall always be working. This means that:

- All of its features/modules shall be properly documented through quality code + descriptive text where appropriate. Use `type annotation` for increased readability.
- The `ScenarioGenerator` is successfully able to generate any scenario from valid config files.
- The `Simulator` is successfully able to run through any number of scenarios, either generated or loaded from file. Furthermore, it should be problem free to save and load scenarios to/from (valid) scenario files.
- The `Visualizer`is successfully able to visualize each of these scenarios live, if toggled on.
- Subsystems added to the `Ship` class properly adheres to their interfaces (prefixed with `I` in front of the class name, e.g. interface `IModel` for the ship model interface).

### Project and master thesis work
For students who use this repository for their project/master work, we want you to be free to experiment with the code. In order to enable this, such work shall be performed in branches prepended with `project/<year>/`. For example, if Per in 2023 is working on his master thesis creating a deep reinforcement learning-based trajectory tracking controller, he should do so by branching out from `main` into his own branch called e.g. `project/2023/drl-controller`. This makes browsing the branches later easier.

### Features and dedicated improvements

A lot of the work being done on code repositories is adding needed features, or improving the platform in general.

The branches used to develop these features shall be prepended with `feature/`, e.g.
`feature/improved_ship_configuration`.

It is also a good idea to keep the features small, so that they are easy to test, and can quickly be merged into `main`.

### Workflow

When you're developing a feature (or beginning your thesis work) based on the simulator, the workflow begins by checking out the main branch, and creating a new branch from there.

#### Retrieving main branch

```bash
cd colav_simulator
git checkout main
git pull
# If you need to rebase because you have uncommited (non-important) changes in your working directory, you can run:
git reset --hard origin/main
```

#### Creating new branch

A new branch for new features is created like this:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/name_of_feature
```

#### Performing work and updating branch

Now that you have a separate branch, you can code, commit, run experiments and cooperate in that branch.

```bash
# Do some work
git add <files>
git commit
git push -u origin feature/name_of_feature # -u flag with origin only needed first time to set upstream.
```

#### Performing tests before merging into main

After doing some development and thorough testing, it might be time to merge the feature into the `main` branch.
Before doing that, make sure that all checkpoints under the heading [_Main branch_](#Main-branch) are satisfied.

To make sure new issues don't arise when merging into `main` later (because of other changes to `main`), it is important to merge `main` into `feature/name_of_feature` first:

```bash
git checkout main   # make sure we have the latest
git pull            # version of main locally
git checkout feature/name_of_feature
git pull # in case you or someone else made changes remotely
git merge main # This attempts to merge `main` into `feature/name_of_feature`
# At this point conflicts might arise which you have to solve.
```

Now you can perform the tests.

After the tests have been completed, you can initiate a pull request on github, where eventually the changes will be merged to `main`.

#### Pull request

Go to the `colav_simulator` repo on <https://github.com> and navigate to your branch (`feature/name_of_feature`).
In the status bar above the commit message there is a link for _Pull request_.
Click that and describe your feature.
Assign people to it to review the changes, and create the pull request.

The pull request should now be reviewed by someone, and if it is ok, it will be merged into `main`.
Congratulations! It is now safe to delete the feature branch, which is strongly encouraged in order to keep the repository tidy.


## Main modules in the repository

Each main module mostly have their own test files, to enable easier debug/fixing and also for making yourself familiar with the code. When developing new modules, you are encouraged to simultaneously develop test files for these, such that yourself and others more conveniently can fix/debug and test the modules separately.

A core concept is the usage of Cerberus for configuration validation, where the validation schemas are used to verify configuration keys and fail fast if erroneous settings are provided. Furthermore, another core concept is the usage of dataclasses for keeping parameters and configuration objects. Each scope (models, guidances, ship, etc..) have its own `Config` object containing its local configuration parameters. This leads to better readability of the code by keeping all aspects of a given subsystem in its own scope, as opposed to passing global configuration objects everywhere. Dataclasses also increases readability and reduces bugs related to specifying wrong dictionary string keys that would happen when only using dictionaries for configuration settings.

The following describes the main modules superficially. Rely mainly on the code itself for the documentation.

### COLAVEnvironment

Gymnasium-wrapper for the simulation framework. See the source code for available rewards, actions and observations that can be used.

### Simulator

The simulator runs through a set of scenarios, each consisting of `n_episodes` specified from the config, visualizes these and saves the results. The scenarios can be generated through a `ScenarioConfig` object, or loaded from file using an existing scenario definition (examples under `scenarios/`).

It is recommended to pass the `COLAV` planning algorithm you want to test on the own-ship at run-time to the `run(...)` function in the simulator (see its documentation and an example for this in `tests/test_simulator.py`).  The planning algorithm must inherit/adhere to the `ICOLAV`-interface under `colav_simulator/core/colav/colav_interface.py` (same principle goes for all the `Ship` subsystems).

The simulator is configured using the `simulator.yaml` config file.

### Scenario Generator

The scenario generator is used by the simulator to create new scenarios for COLAV testing with 1+ ships. The main method is the `generate()` function, which generates a scenario from a scenario config file, which is converted into a `ScenarioConfig` object. An Electronic Navigational Chart object (from Seacharts) is used to define the environment. The `n_episodes` (defaults to 1) parameter is used to facilitate Monte Carlo simulation when using random data, and one can use an `EpisodeGenerationConfig` for further MC specifications.

Scenarios are configured through a scenario `.yaml` file as e.g. the example `head_on.yaml` file under `scenarios` in the root folder. Look at predefined scenario files and the `schemas` folder under the package source code for further clues constraints/tips on how to write a new scenario config files.

Seacharts is used to provide access to Electronic Navigational Charts, and an `ENC` object is used inside the `ScenarioGenerator` class for this. One must here make sure that the seacharts package is properly setup with `.gdb` data in the `data/external` folder of the package, with correctly matching `UTM` zone for the chart data. An example default `seacharts.yaml`config file for the module is found under `config/`. One can specify map data, map origin, map size etc. for the ENC object from the scenario `.yaml`config file.

Troubles with "freezing" when you generate a scenario? Check if you have specified `new_load_of_map_data=True`in the scenario configuration file. If this is false, and the map data is not loaded/wrong data is used, errors can happen.

In addition to random waypoint generation and/or straight line motion generation for the own-ship and/or target ships through the `BehaviorGenerator` class, the `rrt-rs` library can optionally be used for generating random ship behaviors, where Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) are built for each ship initial state. See the source code for the `BehaviorGenerator` for more information.

NOTE: The random generation of scenarios (poses, waypoints, speed plans etc.) are not guaranteed to succeed every time, especially since a finite number of iterations are considered in sampling procedures (for time and robustness reasons). Many edge cases can occur that makes a particular ship-ship encounter scenario unrealistic or not interesting. This makes it important that you check the generated scenarios.

### Visualizer

Class responsible for visualizing scenarios run through by the Simulator, and visualizing/saving the results from these. A basic live plotting feature when simulating scenarios is available. The class can, as most other main modules, be configured from the example simulator configuration file under `config/`.

Note that the visualizer uses Matplotlib, and scales badly with a large number of vessels and plot data. Use with care. See Roadmap below.

### Ship
#### Interface and core functionality
The Ship class simulates the behaviour of an individual ship and must adhere to the `IShip` interface, which necessitates that the ship class provides among others, a:

- `forward(self, dt: float, w = Optional[DisturbanceData] = None) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, np.ndarray]` function that allows simple forward simulation of the vessel, with disturbance consideration if data is available. Returns the new state, inputs to get there and the references used.
- `plan(self, t: float, dt: float, do_list: List[Tuple[int, np.ndarray, np.ndarray, float, float]], enc: Optional[ENC] = None, w: Optional[DisturbanceData] = None) -> np.ndarray` function that plans a new trajectory/generates new references for the ship, either using the guidance system or COLAV system. A list of dynamic obstacle data, possibly Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) object and disturbance information can be used by the planner.
- `track_obstacles(self, t: float, dt: float, true_do_states: List[Tuple[int, np.ndarray, float, float]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, np.ndarray, np.ndarray, float, float]], List[Tuple[int, np.ndarray]]]:` function that tracks nearby dynamic obstacles.

Standardized input/output formats are used for the interfaces to make the code for each subsystem easy to switch in/out. For the Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) system, we consider interface input/output dimensions based on a typical 3DOF surface vessel model (see Fossen, 2011 for reference):

- State of dimension `nx = 6` x 1 consisting of `[x, y, psi, u, v, r]^T` for the typical 3DOF model case (`^T` for transposed vectors). For kinematic models or other models with reduced state dimension, the first entries are filled out. For the kinematic model in the framework this equates to setting the state as `[x, y, chi, U, 0, 0]^T` where `chi` is the course over ground and `U` the speed over ground.
- Inputs of dimension `nu = 3` x 1 consisting of the generalized forces and moments `[X, Y, N]^T` for the 3DOF ship model. When using e.g. a kinematic model that has different state and input dimensions, the ship controller will nominally just feed references (typically in course and speed) directly forward to the ship model (Must be configured. See below for examples).
- References are of dimension 9 x N, where N is the number of trajectory samples, consisting of 3DOF reference poses, velocities and accelerations in general. E.g. for LOS-guidance the references will be populated as `[0, 0, chi_ref, U_ref, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]^T` and passed to the ship low-level controller.

If you need to implement a model which has state, input or reference dimensions larger than the aforementioned, make an issue on the topic and pull request with the necessary interface changes.

#### Subsystem Configurations
The ship can be configured to use different combinations of collision avoidance algorithms, guidance systems, controllers, estimators, sensors, and models. The key element here is that each subsystem provides a standard inferface, which any external module using the subsystem must adhere to.  See the source code and test files for more in depth info on the functionality. Check out the `ship_list` entry under the `schemas/scenario.yaml` to get a clue on what you can configure for the ship. NOTE: The own-ship must always have `ID=0` and is always the first ship to configure under `ship_list`.

If you want to expand the `Ship` object by adding support for a new model, controller, guidance law etc., a rough recipe is the following (in this example for a new model, but the procedure will be the same for any subsystem or module in the framework):

- 1: Implement the model under `core/models.py` or in your own repository, inherit from the `IModel` interface and implement the required interface functions.
- 2: Add a parameter class for the model, and add this parameter class entry to the `models.Config` class to add support for parsing the model from configuration files. This also entails that you implement the `from_dict(config_dict: dict) -> ModelParams` and `to_dict() -> dict:` functions, to allow for easy parsing of dictionaries into dataclasses. However, note that some of the implemented ship models existing in the framework have fixed and non-configurable parameters. In this case, the configuration entry scheme for the model is an empty string (see e.g. for `Telemetron` under `models` in the scenario schema).
- 3: Use the new model parameter class as input to the new model object constructor.
- 4: Add support for the new model by adding its parameter object class to the `models` part of the `schemas/scenario.yaml` files under `ship_list`.
- 5: Test the new model in a scenario where you specify the model parameters in a scenario configuration file, or directly during run-time (as in `test_ship.py`).

In all these steps, adhere to the used code style and docstring format.

Some common configurations of the ship subsystems are detailed below.

#### External Control
In case you are employing an RL-agent through the `COLAVEnvironment`, the `remote_actor` parameter inside the simulator `step(..)`-function is set to true. In this case, the RL-agent sets the ship references (pose, velocity and acceleration / inputs) externally.

#### Guidance, Navigation and Control With a Kinetic Model
The `scenarios/head_on.yaml` scenario contains a typical GNC/autopilot-configuration of the own-ship, where LOS-guidance (given waypoints and a speed plan) provides course and speed references to a low-level controller (in this case a feedback-linearizing surge-heading controller).

The ship `plan` step will then only entail that the configured `guidance` object LOS algorithm computes course+speed references, which are provided to the onboard controller during the `forward` call. The onboard controller then computes the required force vector to track the reference setpoints.

#### Guidance, Navigation and Control With a Kinematic Model
The `scenarios/ais_scenario1.yaml` scenario contains a typical GNC/autopilot-configuration of the own-ship, where LOS-guidance (given waypoints and a speed plan) provides course and speed references that are directly passed through to a simple kinematic ship model. Here, a `PassThroughCS` "controller" is used to allow for passing the guidance system course and speed references straight through the controller step and directly to the ship model.

The ship `plan` step will then only entail that the configured `guidance` object LOS algorithm computes course+speed references, which are provided to the onboard controller and directly forwarded during the `forward` call. The ship model will then directly use the guidance system references as inputs.


#### Planner Providing Inputs and Not (Pose, Velocity, Acceleration) References
In case you want to develop a motion planning algorithm that provides low-level inputs (e.g. generalized force inputs) to the ship instead of the standard 9-entry pose, velocity, acceleration reference format, you can specify a `PassThroughInputs` type of controller. This "controller" essentially lets the input references (which are now low-level inputs from your algorithm) go straight through, such that the controller is in practice disabled. An example of this is found in the `scenarios/simple_planning_example.yaml`, where a rudder-propeller mapping with a specificed lever arm is used to map forces in x and y to include the yaw moment as well.

The ship `plan` step will then entail that you use your wrapped `colav` system, that provide `references` that are low-level inputs. When these are passed to the `controller` object during the `forward` call, they will pass straight through and go into the ship model object.

#### Godlike Target Tracking (Ground Truth Tracking)
If you want to test your planning algorithm with perfect knowledge on nearby vessels, you can specify the `GodTracker` to be used under `tracker` in the scenario configuration file. As this object has no parameters, the configuration entry is an empty string `god_tracker: ''` (see `schemas/scenario.yaml` for clues).

#### Simple Kalman-filter based Target Tracking
The standard support for target tracking in the simulator is to use a Kalman Filter for estimating the states of nearby vessels. Most of the scenario files have examples on how to configure this tracker. Tune the measurement covariance (R) through the sensor configuration, and adjust the scenario configuration based on whether or not you want to consider AIS-measurements, Radar-measurements or both. See the `tests/test_simulator.py` for example usage and `tests/test_radar.py` for the `Radar` class functionality.

#### Multi-Target Tracking with Realistic Track Initiation and Termination
An interface at <https://github.com/NTNU-Autoship-Internal/vimmjipda> exist for coupling the Visibility Interacting Multiple Models Joint Integrated Probabilistic Data Association (VIMMJIPDA) Multi-Target Tracker (MTT) with the simulator, and can be used with the `Radar` sensor (no AIS consideration implemented yet) for tracking multiple ships with simple clutter noise.  See the `tests/test_simulator_jipda.py`for example usage.

#### COLAV
The `colav_interface.py` provides an interface for arbitrary `COLAV` planning algorithms and hierarchys within. See the file for examples/inspiration on how to wrap your own COLAV-planner to make it adhere to the interface. Alternatively, you can provide your own COLAV system through the `ownship_colav_system` input to the simulator `run(.)` function. In any case, the COLAV algorithm should adhere to the `ICOLAV` interface (see `colav_interface.py`). This enables the usage of both internally developed COLAV planners in addition to third-party ones.


## Future Enhancements (Roadmap)
- Create github actions for CI/CD pipeline.
- Mandate unittesting of all modules and their core functionality.
- Improve random generation of vessel COLREGS scenarios. E.g. use AIS data to sample "realistic" vessel trajectories based on a fitted distribution for historical vessel positions and velocities.
- Improve live-visualization in the simulator w.r.t. code readability and run-time. Switch out matplotlib for a faster backend. Matplotlib is known to leak memory, so switching it for e.g. PyGtGraph <https://www.pyqtgraph.org/> or VisPy <https://vispy.org/> is promising.
- Add functionality for saving simulation results to file.
- Streamline installation of `seacharts`, `colav_evaluation_tool` and the `colav_simulator` through a script.
- Separate the large `schemas/scenario.yaml` validation schema into multiple sub-schemas for easier readability.
- Create IsaacGym-wrapper for GPU-enabled parallelized RL.
